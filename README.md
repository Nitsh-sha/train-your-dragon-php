# [Train your Dragons - php](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWZSYv8FSehObtRahOjmOvMbBIed6PuY/view?usp=sharing)

For this dynamic website project, I have chosen a movie tribute based on my favourite animation movie called ‘How to train your dragon’. The movie consists of series of episodes due to its popularity among children and adults alike. The franchise also extends to games and continuous short series on Netflix with on-going new productions. Although the main movies include various characters including humans and dragons. This website is dedicated solely on the dragon characters.
In order to build the website, I use ‘the Avenger Marvel HQ’ movie tribute website as an example. 
Website link:
https://avengers.marvelhq.com/
It’s a dynamic, well-designed website created by Marvel. With a massive fanbase, the website consists all various components to serve its fans including product section, mobile app section, official movie clips, YouTube clips, Character specific videos, comic sections and games sections. 
Although the Avenger website is appealing and user-friendly, it lacks the ability for each member to personalise customise and personalise his/her experience, 
To personalise the experience and enhance user interaction for our ‘How to train you dragon’ fans, I will be adding other dynamic functionality for the website which is not included in the Avenger websites including membership login function, feedback and rating function, member comment and post function (and the ability for other members to response to the post), favourite marking function. This will also provide a better access to information with more effective flow of communication. On the other hand, I will also be looking at database efficiency for fast loading time, scalability, and automation of information flow. 

The website will be based on a development stack of HTML, CSS, JavaScript’s as well as frameworks such as jQuery, Bootstraps and CSS Grids. For backend functionality, the website will use PHP and MySQL database system. Minimalist, mobile-first design is a crucial current trend and will be used in the design process of this website. 

As this website will have multiple pages, maintaining clean code can in one of the priorities. A dynamic design will support easy update on the website, keeping the website dry, as well as improving the workflow through reusable templates.
